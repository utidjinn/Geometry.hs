    A MultiPoint is a 0-dimensional GeometryCollection. The elements of a
    MultiPoint are restricted to Points. The Points are not connected or ordered
    in any semantically important way (see the discussion at
    GeometryCollection). A MultiPoint is simple if no two Points in the
    MultiPoint are equal (have identical coordinate values in X and Y). Every
    MultiPoint is spatially equal under the definition in Clause 6.1.15.3 to a
    simple Multipoint. The boundary of a MultiPoint is the empty set.
